load season stats and filter

```{r}
season2021 <- load_player_stats(2021)
season2021 %>% view()
top_rush <- season2021 %>% 
  group_by(player_id) %>% 
    filter(season_type == "REG", sum(rushing_yards) > 936) %>% 
  ungroup()

top_rush <- top_rush %>% 
  group_by(player_name) %>% 
  mutate(cumulative_rush = cumsum(rushing_yards)) %>% 
  ungroup()

top_rush <- top_rush %>% 
  select(player_id, player_name, recent_team, week, carries, rushing_yards, rushing_tds, rushing_fumbles, rushing_epa, rushing_first_downs, fantasy_points_ppr, cumulative_rush )

top_rush$game <- seq_along(top_rush$player_name)

top_rush %>% count(player_name)
top_rush <- top_rush %>% 
  rename(team_abbr = recent_team)

top_rush <- top_rush %>% 
  left_join(teams_colors_logos, by = c("team_abbr" = "team_abbr"))

```

now for graphs

```{r}

  ggplot(aes(cumulative_rush, player_name, color = player_name)) +
  geom_col() + 
  transition_time(week)

top_rush %>% 
  ggplot(aes(week, cumulative_rush, group = player_name)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  transition_reveal(week)


top_rush %>% 
  ggplot(aes(week, cumulative_rush, group = player_name)) + 
  geom_image(aes(image = team_logo_espn), width = 0.03, alpha = 0.7)

animation <- top_rush %>%
  filter(player_name == "J.Taylor") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(week, cumulative_rush, group = player_name)) +
  geom_line() +

Just D.Henry

```{r}

Now let's compare QBs

```{r}

#try to number by games played
pmja <- pmja %>% 
  arrange(player_name) #groups players

length(pmja$player_name)

pmja %>% group_by(player_name) %>% summarise(n = n())

pmja$game_no <- sequence(c(57, 63))

pmja <- pmja %>% 
  group_by(player_name) %>% 
  mutate(cum_epa = cumsum(passing_epa)) %>% 
  ungroup()

pmja <- pmja %>% 
  left_join(teams_colors_logos, by = c("recent_team" = "team_abbr"))

pmja %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = game_no, y = cum_epa, group = player_name)) +
  #geom_line() +
  geom_image(aes(image = team_logo_espn), size = 0.05)
